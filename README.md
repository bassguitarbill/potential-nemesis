POTENTIAL NEMESIS
=================

I have no idea what I want to do with this project. Ideally I will be aiming to create a game engine for [Great Adventure](https://github.com/ChrisMondok/Great-Adventure), but whether this project will be incorporated into that, or discarded as a learning experience, I cannot say at this time.

I want this to be able to draw
* backgrounds, layered, with different levels of parallax
* midgrounds (not a word?) where things can move and collide
* foregrounds, also with parallax, or perhaps the fabled reverse parallax

The name **Potential Nemesis** was chosen randomly by Github's name generator. I thought it was cool so I went with it.
